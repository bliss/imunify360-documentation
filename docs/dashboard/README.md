* _IP_ - the IP address of the abuser.
There is a color indication for IP address.
  * A gray bubble means that this IP address is currently in the <span class="notranslate">Gray List</span> (so, every connection from this IP address will redirect to the Anti-Bot Challenge).
  * A blue bubble means that this IP address is currently in no one list (<span class="notranslate">White/Gray/Black</span>). IP is not blocked.
  * A white bubble means that this IP address is currently in the <span class="notranslate">White List</span>. IP will never be blocked by Imunify360.
  * A black bubble means that this IP address is currently in the <span class="notranslate">Black List</span>. And access from this IP is totally blocked without ability to unblock by the Anti-Bot Challenge.
  * No bubble is shown when this incident doesn’t contain IP address.
* <span class="notranslate">_Country_ </span>– country origin of the abuser IP address.
* <span class="notranslate">_Count_</span> – the number of times the abuser tried to repeat the action.
* <span class="notranslate">_Event_</span> – description of the event or suspicious activity (as it is described by OSSEC and Mod_Security sensors).

## Firewall


Tne <span class="notranslate">_All Lists_</span> tab allows viewing and managing the IP addresses in the following lists (listed by priority):

* <span class="notranslate">White</span> - the IP will not be blocked
* <span class="notranslate">Drop/Black</span> - the IP will be blocked everywhere, on all ports and services
* <span class="notranslate">Greylist</span> - the IP will be blocked completely on non-web ports (SSH, FTP, etc.), and will be shown Anti-Bot Challenge on web ports (80, 443, hosting panel ports)
* <span class="notranslate">Anti-Bot Challenge</span> - the IP will be shown Anti-Bot challenge on web ports, and will not be blocked on others

The counters for the lists are presented at the top of the table, reflecting the number of records matching the category.

![](/images/Firewall.png)

All the lists are available for search by the IP address as well as by the _Country_ and _Comment_ fields.

The IP address can be in several lists at the same time, and the highest in priority list decides how the IP will be treated.

Here, you can add or edit a comment to an IP, delete IP permanently or move it to the White/Black list. For an IP with full access you can also remove it here.

The <span class="notranslate">_Ports_</span> tab allows to manage the list of blocked ports.


#### How to add IP manually

### Global Black/White list IP management

Administrator can manage IPs globally, this means that you can blacklist or whitelist an IP not only on one server but on a group of servers. 

Prior to manage IPs globally, you should create a group and add servers into it. This can be done via [CLN UI](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/). You can find the complete documentation on how to create and manage servers’ groups [here](https://docs.cln.cloudlinux.com/dashboard/#server-groups).

When you have created a group in CLN and added IPs into this group, go to _Imunify360 > Firewall > White list_ or _Black list_.
You will see the _Scope_ column and controls (on clicking the _Add_ button) to manage IP locally (on a current server) or globally (on a group of servers).

![](/images/global_IP_management.png)

#### How to change Scope to Group/Local

To change the scope to <span class="notranslate">_Group/Local_</span>, first [create your groups](https://docs.cln.cloudlinux.com/dashboard/#how-to-add-a-server-to-a-group) in the CLN.

![](/images/CLNGroups.png)

After that, go to <span class="notranslate">_Firewall > White/Black list_</span> and select an IP.


* In the <span class="notranslate">_Actions_</span> column click ![](/images/gear.png).
* Choose <span class="notranslate">_Change scope to Group/Local_</span>.
* In the opened popup click <span class="notranslate">_Yes, change scope to Group/Local_</span> or click <span class="notranslate">_Cancel_</span> to close the popup.

![](/images/change_scope.png)

### Ports

This feature allows to block specific ports for TCP/UDP connection. It is also possible to add specific IPs or subnet as a whitelisted so that the rule for the port will not work.

Click <span class="notranslate">_Firewall_</span> and choose <span class="notranslate">_Ports_</span>.

![](/images/Blocked_Ports1.png)

Choose the default blocking mode:

* All open, except specified
* All close, except specified

Or you can set the default blocking mode via [CLI and config file](/config_file_description/).

Exact ports and port-ranges to be allowed can be configured by the following fields in the config file:

* FIREWALL.TCP_IN_IPv4
* FIREWALL.TCP_OUT_IPv4
* FIREWALL.UDP_IN_IPv4
* FIREWALL.UDP_OUT_IPv4
  
Changes of config files will be applied automatically. You don’t need to restart the server or Imunify360.

:::warning Note
The feature doesn’t support IPv6 addresses at this moment and CSF needs to be disabled due to conflicts.
:::


::: tip Note
If CSF integration enabled, then <span class="notranslate">Blocked Ports</span> will be disabled. Imunify360 imports Closed ports and their whitelisted IPs from CSF.
:::

Use filters to show the exact list of the IPs:

* _IP_ – allows filtering the list by IP. Enter an IP or a part of it into the input field.
* <span class="notranslate">_Country_</span> – allows filtering the list by country origin. Enter a country name into the input field with autocomplete. Imunify360 will show the list of IPs of the chosen country.
* <span class="notranslate">Comments</span> – allows filtering the list by comments. Enter a comment into the input field.
* Use <span class="notranslate">_Items per page_</span> at the page bottom right to set the number of the incidents to be shown on the page.

The following actions are available for the ports:

* add port to the list of blocked ports
* edit ports in the list of blocked ports
* add a comment
* delete permanently

#### Add a port to the list of blocked ports

On the <span class="notranslate">_Lists_</span> page choose <span class="notranslate">_Blocked ports_</span> and click <span class="notranslate">_Add_</span>. In the pop-up specify the following:

* <span class="notranslate">Port</span> – the number of the port to be added to the list of blocked ports.
* TCP/UDP – tick the checkboxes of connection types for the port that should be blocked.
* <span class="notranslate">Enter comment</span> (optional) – a text to be added as a note for the port.
* <span class="notranslate">Whitelisted IPs</span> – add IPs separated by comma to the White List. They will be able to use the port.

Click <span class="notranslate">_Add Port_</span> to proceed or <span class="notranslate">_Cancel_</span> to close the pop-up.

![](/images/add_port.png)

#### Edit ports in the blocked ports list

To add an IP or a subnet to the <span class="notranslate">White List</span> for the port, click _+IP_ and in the <span class="notranslate">_Add IP/Subnet_</span> pop-up specify the following:

* Enter IP – IP or subnet that should be added to the whitelist
* Enter description – a description to be added as a note to the IP or subnet.

![](/images/add_ip_ports.png)


#### Delete permanently

To delete a port or separate IP/subnet, click _Bin_ icon in the row of the element.

The table has the following columns:

* <span class="notranslate">**Scan date**</span> — displays the exact time when a file was detected as malicious.
* <span class="notranslate">**Type**</span> — <span class="notranslate">Malware Database Scanner</span> or <span class="notranslate">Malware Scanner</span>.
  :::tip Note
  To function properly <span class="notranslate">Malware Database Scanner</span> requires MariaDB/MySQL DB management system version 5.5. Recommended version is 5.6+. Note, that only WordPress, Joomla, and Magento databases are supported now.
  :::
* <span class="notranslate">**Username**</span> — displays file owner name.
* <span class="notranslate">**Malicious**</span> — the path where the file is located starting with root.
* <span class="notranslate">**Reason**</span> — describes the signature which was detected during the scanning process. Names in this column depend on the signature vendor. You can derive some information from the signature ID itself. `SMW-SA-05155-wshll` – in this Signature ID:
	* The first section can be either `SMW` or `CMW`. `SMW` stands for Server Malware and `CMW` stands for Client Malware
	* The second section of ID can be either `INJ` or `SA`. `INJ` stands for Injection (means Malware is Injected to some legitimate file) and `SA` stands for StandAlone (means File is Completely Malicious)
	* The third section is `05155`. This is simply an identification number for the signature.
	* The fourth section `wshll/mlw.wp/etc` explains the category and class of malware identified. Here, `wshll` stands for web shell (`mlw` stands for malware).
	* The fifth section is `0`, which provides the version number of the signature.
* <span class="notranslate">**Status**</span> — displays the file status:
  * <span class="notranslate">**Infected**</span> — threat was detected after scanning. If a file was not cleaned after cleanup, the info icon is displayed. Hover mouse over info icon to display the reason;
  * <span class="notranslate">**Cleaned**</span> —  infected file is cleaned up.
  * <span class="notranslate">**Content removed**</span> — a file content was removed after cleanup.
  * <span class="notranslate">**Cleanup in progress**</span> — infected file cleanup is in progress now.
* <span class="notranslate">**Actions**</span>:
  * <span class="notranslate">**Add to Ignore List**</span> — add file to the <span class="notranslate">Ignore List</span> and remove it from the <span class="notranslate">Malicious files</span> list. Note that if a file is added to the <span class="notranslate">Ignore List</span>, Imunify360 will no longer scan this file. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Gear_</span> symbol ![](/images/gear.png) and select <span class="notranslate">_Add to Ignore List_</span>.
  * <span class="notranslate">**View file**</span> — click <span class="notranslate">_View file_</span> symbol ![](/images/view_file_symbol.png) in the file line and the file content will be displayed in the pop-up. Only the first 100Kb of the file content will be shown in case if a file has bigger size.
  * <span class="notranslate">**Cleanup file**</span> — click <span class="notranslate">_Clean up_</span> symbol ![](/images/cleanup_symbol.png) to clean up all infected files within the account.
  * <span class="notranslate">**Restore original file (before cleanup)**</span> — click <span class="notranslate">_Restore original_</span> symbol ![](/images/restore_original_symbol.png) to restore the original content removed as infected.
  * <span class="notranslate">**Restore from backup**</span> — click the <span class="notranslate">_Gear_</span> symbol ![](/images/gear.png) and select <span class="notranslate">_Try to restore from backup_</span> to restore the original file before it got infected if it exists.

### Scan

</div>

It is possible to scan a specific directory for malware. Go to <span class="notranslate">_Malware Scanner_</span> page and choose <span class="notranslate">_Scan_</span> tab. Then proceed the following steps:

1. Enter a folder name you need to scan in the <span class="notranslate">_Folder to scan_</span> field. Start typing with the slash `/`.

    It is possible to use Advanced Settings:

   * <span class="notranslate">_Filename mask_</span>. It allows to set file type for scanning (for example, `*.php` – all the files with extension php). Default setting is `*` which means all files without restriction.
   * <span class="notranslate">_Ignore mask_</span>. It allows to set file type to ignore (for example, `*.html` – will ignore all file with extension html).
   * <span class="notranslate">_CPU consumption_</span>. Defines the CPU consumption for scanning without decreasing efficiency:
	     * from <span class="notranslate">Low</span> to <span class="notranslate">High</span>.
   * <span class="notranslate">_I/O consumption_</span>. Defines the I/O consumption for scanning without decreasing efficiency:
	     * from <span class="notranslate">Low</span> to <span class="notranslate">High</span>.
	* <span class="notranslate">_Follow symlinks_</span>. Follow all symlinks within the folder to scan. 

:::tip Note
If Imunify360 is running on CloudLinux OS, LVE is used to manage scan intensity. If it is running on other operating systems, “nice” is used to control CPU and “ionice” is used when the I/O scheduler is CFQ.

## Proactive Defense


### Overview

 
<span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is a unique Imunify360 feature that can prevent malicious activity through PHP scripts. It is available as a PHP module for Apache and LiteSpeed web servers and analyzes script activity using known patterns like obfuscated command injection, malicious code planting, sending spam, SQL injection etc.

:::tip Note
Proactive Defense requires [Hardened PHP](/dashboard/#installation) (alt-php) to operate.
:::

### User Interface

Go to <span class="notranslate">Imunify360 → Proactive Defense</span>.

![](/images/proactivedefensemain_zoom70.png)

Here you can set a mode, view detected events and perform actions on them.

#### Mode Settings

The following <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> modes are available:
* <span class="notranslate">Disabled</span> — means that <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> feature is not working and a system is not protected enough
* <span class="notranslate">Log Only</span> — means that possible malicious activity is only logged, no actions are performed (default mode)
* <span class="notranslate">Kill Mode</span> — the highest level of protection — the script is terminated as soon as malicious activity is detected

To select a mode, tick the desired checkbox. When an action is completed, you will see a pop-up with the successful mode changing message.

#### How to test Proactive Defense

1. Set <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> to <span class="notranslate">_Log only_</span> mode (requests will not be blocked) or to <span class="notranslate">_Kill mode_</span> to kill all requests.
2. Add the following row in order to enable test mode rules:

<div class="notranslate">
	
```	
echo 'check_mode = -10' >> /usr/share/i360-php-opts/module.ini
```
</div>

3. Create a file with the following content:

<div class="notranslate">

``` PHP
<?php
$pattern = 'TEST-FILE';
$external_code = @file_get_contents('https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt');
if (strpos($external_code,$pattern)){
    print "Poactive Defence DOESN'T work or NOT in KILL mode";
}
else {
    print "Proactive Defence works fine - file_get_contents function has been BLOCKED, please check Imunify360 Proactive Defence tab for corresponding BLOCK event";
}
?>
```
</div>

:::tip Note
This script is available starting from Imunify360 v. 4.10.2  
This script will only check for PD if file_get_contents is not disabled and allow_url_fopen is enabled in the PHP settings on the server.
:::

4. Place this file on the server.
5. Call a test page with the script from the point 2.
6. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is disabled, you will see "PD doesn't work or not in KILL mode" message after calling the script and no records will appear in "Incident" tab.
7. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is enabled and <span class="notranslate">_Log only_</span> mode is set, you will see "PD doesn't work or not in KILL mode" message after calling the script and a new event with description "Blamer detection" in the <span class="notranslate">_Detected Events_</span> table with "LOG" action.
8. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is enabled and <span class="notranslate">_Kill mode_</span> is set, the test page returns an error.And a new event with description "Blamer detection" in the <span class="notranslate">_Detected Events_</span> table with "KILL" action.
9. Remove the following row from the <span class="notranslate">`/usr/share/i360-php-opts/module.ini`</span> in order to disable test mode rules

<div class="notranslate">
	
```
check_mode = -10
```
</div>

::: tip Note
the number of triggered rule is 77777 and it is possible to check it via CLI
<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent proactive list
```
</div>
:::

#### opcache.jit in PHP8 and the Proactive Defense module

Starting from PHP 8, the interpreter supports `opcache.jit` option to enable just-in-time compilation of the code. 

When the <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> extension (or any other PHP extensions that use the hooks to intercept function calls) is enabled, opcache engine disables `opcache.jit` automatically and reports it into the error log. It does not affect the stability and performance of websites running PHP 8 when both `opcache.jit` and the <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> module are enabled, but the JIT will be off.

To keep `opcache.jit` forcibly enabled and keep the <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> module enabled, one needs to add the following config option:

```
jit_compatible_mode=on
```

in the `/usr/share/i360-php-opts/module.ini` file.


## Reputation Management

Choose <span class="notranslate">_Reputation Management_</span> in the main menu of the Imunify360 admin interface to get to the <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> page.

<span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> allows to check if a domain registered on your server is safe or not based on the following reputation engines:

* [Yandex Safe Browsing](https://tech.yandex.com/safebrowsing/)
* [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/)
* [OpenPhish](https://openphish.com/)
* [Mitchellkrogz](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Phishing.Database/)

How does it work:

* We get a list of domains periodically (via crontab)
* Send it to the central Imunify360 server
* Get results from it
* Add bad domains to the list of <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span>

If a domain or an IP is blocked, then this information will be available in the table below. If a user’s website appears in this table, then it would be useful to send [this link](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/hacked/) to the user. This instruction can help to solve problems with the domain.

At the top of the page (also in the main menu near <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> item), Imunify360 shows the number of affected domains. This number is a quantity of affected domains that exist on the server.

The table shows:

* <span class="notranslate">_ID_</span> – domain owner username
* _URL_ – the affected domain link
* <span class="notranslate">_Type_</span> – read more about types [on the link](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/reference/rest/v4/ThreatType) (we still do not support <span class="notranslate">THREAT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED</span> and <span class="notranslate">POTENTIALLY_HARMFUL_APPLICATION</span>).
* <span class="notranslate">_Detection time_</span> – exact time when the <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> has detected the domain

![](/images/reputation_zoom73.png) 

Click link icon in the <span class="notranslate">_Action_</span> column to copy the URL to the clipboard.

::: tip Note
<span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> online and browser look may differ. This is because Google Safe Browsing has an issue described on github.
:::

:::

#### Privilege escalation detection & protection <Badge text="Deprecated" type="error" vertical="top"/>

:::warning Warning!
This feature is deprecated.
:::

The KernelCare extension for Imunify360 allows tracing malicious invocations to detect privilege escalation attempts.

You can find these attempts on the [Incidents tab](/dashboard/#incidents) (as part of the OSSEC log). The incidents can be seen by filtering events with the `EDF` label. 

To enable the feature, tick the <span class="notranslate">_Privilege escalation detection & protection_</span> checkbox.

![](/images/pep_kernelcare.png)

:::warning Note
The _Privilege escalation detection & protection_ feature is implemented for CentOS 7 only.
:::

Or you can enable it via CLI using the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"KERNELCARE": {"edf": true}}'
```
</div>


Click <span class="notranslate">_Save changes_</span> button on the bottom of the section to save changes.

#### WAF Settings

When the <span class="notranslate">_Minimized ModSec Ruleset_</span> option is on, it disables Imunify WAF rules with a high memory footprint, yet leaves critical ruleset enabled. It is recommended for the servers with a small amount of RAM. It is enabled by default for the installations with low RAM.

You can switch back to the normal mode by enabling WebShield or unchecking <span class="notranslate">_Minimized ModSec Ruleset_</span> in Settings | General | WAF Settings

Click <span class="notranslate">_Save changes_</span> button on the bottom of the section to save changes.

#### WordPress Account Brute-force Protection

We have two protection features against brute-force - one, Weak Password Login Prevention - prevents any logins with a weak password (e.g. "1234"), and the other Compromised Account Login Detection redirects known compromised accounts to reset their passwords.

Server admin can enable an option to prevent access to WordPress accounts with well-known (trivial) passwords.
When the option is enabled, all end-users that are trying to log into the admin account with weak/trivial or well-known passwords from the dictionary used by brute-forcers will be taken to the special alert page with an appeal to change their current password.

This feature can be enabled by setting <span class="notranslate">`cms_account_compromise_prevention` to `true`</span> in MOD_SEC [config file section](/config_file_description/#config-file-description)

:::tip Note
This feature is implemented via modsec rule and could be [disabled on a per-domain basis](/command_line_interface/#rules) (the rule id is 33355)
:::

![](/images/WAF_Weak_Password_Login_Prevention.png)

The alert page supports localization and is displayed in the language of the browser (on an external Imunify domain).

The WordPress Compromised Account Detection works independently of the Weak Passwords Prevention feature utilizing Cloud Based heuristic analysis. 

Our heuristics analyze suspicions actions of the accounts such as malware drops, malicious plugins installation, other account actions and deliver a verdict to the specific host that are considered compromised. When account tries to login on the host, it will be redirected to the reminder to change the password. This feature does not have a switch in our settings and will produce alerts until the breach is fixed.

It employs the RBL system, and there is currently no settings switch to enable/disable it.

![](/images/WAF_Compromised_Account_Login_Prevention.png) 

#### CMS-specific WAF Rules

WAF Rules Auto-Configurator generates a set of rules on a per-domain basis, considering the Content Management System (CMS), that the website is running (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal etc).

It allows making WAF rules more effective to protect websites and reduce the number os false positives.

It works in the background and scans domains for installed CMS daily, after that rebuilds ModSec configuration based on detected software.

![](/images/cms-specific_waf_rules.png)

:::tip Note
This feature is only available for the Apache 2.4 web server
:::

#### DoS Protection

<span class="notranslate">DoS Protection</span> section allows to enable or disable DoS protection. DoS protection works by counting connections from each remote IP address per local port separately.
To enable/disable it, tick the <span class="notranslate">_Enable Dos Protection_</span> checkbox. Or you can enable it using the following CLI command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"DOS": {"enabled": true}}'
```
</div>

It is possible to configure how Imunify360 will behave:

* <span class="notranslate">_Max Connections_</span>– allows to setup the number of simultaneous connections allowed before IP will be blocked. Cannot be set lower than 100.
* <span class="notranslate">_Check delay_</span> – allows to setup period in seconds between each DoS detection system activation that will check a server for DoS attack. Also, it is possible to set different limits for different local ports by editing the [configuration file](/config_file_description/) directly.

**The minimum values**: 

* Max Connections = 100
* Check delay = 30

:::tip Note
_Check delay_ is limited by the minimum value of 30, lower values can cause "false positives" triggering.
:::

:::tip Note
Although DoS protection works on the TCP level, it is not the same as http request rate - even if there is large number of http connections, the number of TCP connections can be relatively low.
:::

:::tip Note
Imunify360 DoS protection is automatically disabled if CSF is active - a warning is shown in Imunify360 UI in that case
:::
	
![](/images/DosProtection.png)

Click <span class="notranslate">_Save changes_</span> button on the bottom of the section to save changes.

#### Enhanced DOS Protection

The Enhanced DOS Protection feature forms an additional layer of protection, increasing the stability of servers facing DOS attacks. It takes a different approach than our existing [DOS Protection feature](/dashboard/#dos-protection), which focuses on monitoring the number of simultaneous connections. Enhanced DOS Protection, on the other hand, monitors the rate of requests originating from attacker IP addresses per unit of time.

The new feature works better against attacks based on short-living connections and against attacks where the number of requests grows fast (hundreds of requests per second). As Enhanced DOS Protection monitors the number of requests in real-time, it reacts to the threats almost instantly, greylisting the detected IPs and redirecting their requests to the Anti-Bot challenge.

Standard DoS protection, in turn, will block attacks that use long-lived connections (e.g. Slowloris attacks), so these functions complement each other perfectly.

You can find all incidents related to the new feature in the incidents table by the description: 

```
“Denial of Service (DoS) attack was discovered from %IP%: %threshold% connections per %timeframe% seconds to %port% port”.
```

<h4>Activating and fine-tuning Enhanced DOS Protection</h4>

The feature is switched off by default. You can activate Enhanced DOS Protection in Imunify360 using the following CLI command:

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"ENHANCED_DOS":{"enabled":true}}'
```

The default timeframe (seconds) and threshold of request (number) could be changed by the following CLI commands:

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"ENHANCED_DOS":{"timeframe":60}}'
```
```
imunify360-agent config update '{"ENHANCED_DOS":{"default_limit":500}}'
```

Request limits for different ports could be set separately, using the following CLI commands:

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"ENHANCED_DOS": {"port_limits": {"80": 150}}}'
```

We also recommend checking and configuring the CAPTCHA_DOS section of [parameters](/config_file_description) to blacklist IPs after repetitive requests to the captcha.

#### SMTP Traffic Manager

SMTP traffic management provides more control over SMTP traffic.

An administrator can redirect mail traffic to the local MTA, block it completely, or keep it available for local mails only. Administrators can also block particular ports and whitelist specific users or groups for outgoing mail.

This feature extends the existing cPanel <span class="notranslate">“Block SMTP”</span> functionality, albeit with more control and capabilities, and replaces the similar functionality from CSF. 

You can enable the <span class="notranslate">SMTP Traffic Management</span> in the <span class="notranslate">Settings</span>:

![](/images/SMTPSettings.png)

* <span class="notranslate">**SMTP ports**</span> - a list of the ports to be blocked. The defaults are: 25, 587,465
* <span class="notranslate">**Allow users**</span> a list of the users to be ignored (not blocked). By default it is empty. Including Unix and CPanel users (if a process that sends an email has a UID of one of the <span class="notranslate">`allow_users`</span>, it will not be blocked)
* <span class="notranslate">**Allow groups**</span> - a list of the groups to be ignored (not blocked). By default it is empty. Including Unix and CPanel users (if a process that sends an email has a UID of one of the <span class="notranslate">`allow_users`</span>, it will not be blocked)
* <span class="notranslate">**Allow local**</span> - block all except the local SMTP (localhost). By default it is disabled.
* <span class="notranslate">**Redirect to local**</span> - enable automatic redirection to the local ports for outgoing mail traffic. By default it is disabled.

::: warning 
Note that the term "group" here means the primary group of UNIX users. 

For example, we have a user "john" whose primary group is "john" and the supplementary group is "admin":
* If you add a rule for the group "john", it'd match (the user would be allowed to send emails).
* If a rule is added for the group "admin", it wouldn't match (the user would be denied sending emails) because "admin" isn't a primary group of user "john". 
:::

::: tip Note
The following is added by default into the _Allow users_ and the _Allow groups_ for cPanel:
* UIDs - 0 (root), 202 (cpanel)
* GIDs - 12 (mail) 
:::

To enable these settings via direct config file update or a command-line interface, use this command: 

<div class="notranslate">

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"SMTP_BLOCKING": {"allow_local": true, "enable": true}}'
```
</div>

The config file should show:

<div class="notranslate">

```
SMTP_BLOCKING:
 allow_groups:
 - mailacc
 allow_local: true
 allow_users: []
 enable: true
 ports:
 - 25
 - 587
 - 465
 redirect: true
```
</div>

#### What if the Conflict with WHM >> SMTP Restrictions message is shown?

When you first enable the RapidScan feature, the first scan will run as before. But subsequent scans will see a dramatic speed improvement, anywhere between 5 to 20 times faster. You can find details [here](/features/#rapidscan).
* <span class="notranslate">_Binary (ELF) malware detection_</span> – this option allows to search for any binaries (ELF files) in the user home directories and consider them malicious.
* <span class="notranslate">_Enable Hyperscan_</span> – this option allows to use the regex matching Hyperscan library in Malware Scanner to greatly improve the scanning speed. Hyperscan requires its own signatures set that will be downloaded from the files.imunify360.com and compiled locally. 
There are few platform requirements to use this feature:
  * Hyperscan supports Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS/CloudLinux 7 and later.
  * SSE3 processor instructions support. It is quite common nowadays, but may be lacking in virtual environments or in some rather old servers.

#### Crontab files Scanning

This is the mechanism allowing to address Crontab infections with our powerful Malware scanner. Enabled, it will catch any event of Crontab file modification on the fly in seconds and keep them malware-free in real-time.

<img src="/images/crontabScanning.png" border="1px solid grey"/>

The cleanup results are available on the *Malware* and *History* tabs of the Imunify360 interface as for any other type of malware.

Tick required checkboxes and click <span class="notranslate">_Save changes_</span> button.

#### Background Scanning

Allows to set up automatic, scheduled, background scanning of user accounts.

* <span class="notranslate">_Run scanning_</span> — select the desired period:
  * <span class="notranslate">Never</span>
  * <span class="notranslate">Daily</span>
  * <span class="notranslate">Weekly</span>
  * <span class="notranslate">Monthly</span>

![](/images/background_scanning1.png)

Depending on the selected period, precise settings.

* If <span class="notranslate">_Run scanning_</span> is set to <span class="notranslate">_Daily_</span>, choose the exact time at the <span class="notranslate">_Run at_</span> dropdown.

* If <span class="notranslate">_Run scanning_</span> is set to <span class="notranslate">_Weekly_</span>, choose the day of the week at the <span class="notranslate">_Run on_</span> dropdown and exact time at the <span class="notranslate">_Run at_</span> dropdown.

* If <span class="notranslate">_Run scanning_</span> is set to <span class="notranslate">_Monthly_</span>, choose the day of the month at the <span class="notranslate">_Day of month to run_</span> dropdown and exact time at the <span class="notranslate">_Run at_</span> dropdown.

You can track the scanning activity at the <span class="notranslate">[Malware Scanner](#malware-scanner)</span> tab.


#### Cleanup

* <span class="notranslate">_Trim file instead of removal_</span> — do not remove infected file during cleanup but make the file zero-size (for malware like web-shells);
* <span class="notranslate">_Keep original files for … days_</span> — the original infected file is available for restoration within the defined period. The default is 14 days.

![](/images/malwarescannersettings_zoom70.png)


#### Proactive Defense

* <span class="notranslate">_Enable Blamer_</span> — tick to allow Imunify360 to find a root cause of how infection got injected into the server through PHP. Blamer pinpoints the exact URL, PHP script & PHP execution path that allowed a hacker to inject malware onto the server.
Imunify360 security team will use that information to prevent future infections from happening.

![](/images/SettingsBlamer.png)

To reduce the number of blamer events, similar events are combined by default into a single one. In order to disable it, specify the <span class="notranslate">`filter_messages=off`</span> in the <span class="notranslate">_/usr/share/i360-php-opts/module.ini_</span>

* <span class="notranslate">_PHP Immunity_</span> — tick to allow Imunify360 automatically detect and patch vulnerabilities in software at the Proactive Defense level preventing re-infections through the same vulnerability.

Once a vulnerable script or unknown malware executes any malicious flow which in turn leads to a malware drop, it causes the auto-generate rule to be released for the Proactive Defence. Ultimately, it will stop any further attempts to exploit the vulnerability or drop malware. Any dropped malware will be also auto-cleaned by the real-time malware scanner keeping the system clean and protected.

![](/images/SettingsPHPImmunity.png)

By enabling this feature Blamer will be enabled as well and Proactive Defence switched into the KILL mode.

::: tip Note
You can also add a new rule to the <span class="notranslate">Disabled Rules</span> list on the [Incidents](/dashboard/#incidents) page.
:::
The list of disabled rules contains:

* <span class="notranslate">_Rule ID_</span> — ID number of the rule provided by the plugin
* <span class="notranslate">_Plugin_</span> — the name of the firewall plugin of the added rule
* <span class="notranslate">_Description_</span> — rule description or details of the rule from ModSecurity or OSSEC
* <span class="notranslate">_Domains_</span> — the list of the domains for which the rule is disabled (blank field means all domains)

To add a new rule click <span class="notranslate">_Add Rule_</span> button.

![](/images/disabledrulesaddbutton_zoom70.png)

In the pop-up specify the following:

* <span class="notranslate">_Rule ID_</span> — ID provided by firewall plugin;
* Select firewall plugin from the drop-down (ossec for OSSEC, modsec for ModSecurity)
* <span class="notranslate">_Description_</span> — rule description or details from ModSecurity or OSSEC

To remove the rule from the disabled list click <span class="notranslate">_Enable_</span> and confirm the action in the pop-up.

![](/images/disabledrulesenablepopup_zoom60.png)

:::tip Note
To prevent managing the rules there's an option [allow_local_rules_management](/config_file_description/).
:::

#### Config file

An alternative way to disable rules is to use the config file `/etc/imunify360/rules/disabled-rules`. It's especially usable with provisioning tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, etc.

:::tip Note
Please note that all rules in the config file are not visible in the UI above.
:::

The config file contains lines in the following format:

`MODULE_ID:RULE_ID:Description`

Where:

- `MODULE_ID` can have one of the following values:

  - `modsec` for ModSecurity rules
  - `ossec` for OSSEC rules
  - `cphulk` for cpHulkd rules
  - `lfd` for Login Failuer daemon rules

- `RULE_ID` is the rule id for the module and it is mandatory.

- `Description` - text string without specialized symbols.

Example:

```text
modsec:1010:
ossec:1008
modsec:1001:this is why
```
